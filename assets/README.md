## Hard Rubik's Cube Problems

The file `qtm.txt`, courtesy of <a href="cube20.org">cube20.org</a>, contains scrambles for 3,324 different positions of distance 24, 2 of distance 25, and 1 of distance 26 in the quarter turn metric.

The states are generated by the functions given in `deepspeedcube/eval/load_hard_cube_states.py`.
